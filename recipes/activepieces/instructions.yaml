description: Setup instructions for ActivePieces automation platform

steps:
  - title: "Install ActivePieces"
    description: |
      ActivePieces runs as a single container using PGLite (embedded database) and
      in-memory Redis — no external Postgres or Redis services required.

      The container is exposed on port 30120.

  - title: "Auto-generated secrets"
    description: |
      During setup, two secrets are automatically generated using openssl:
        - AP_JWT_SECRET — 64-character hex string for JWT signing
        - AP_ENCRYPTION_KEY — 32-character hex string for data encryption

      These are stored in the environment and persist across restarts.

  - title: "First launch"
    description: |
      1. Open http://127.0.0.1:30120 in your browser
      2. Sign-up is disabled by default (AP_SIGN_UP_ENABLED=false).
         To create your first admin account, temporarily set AP_SIGN_UP_ENABLED=true
         in the docker-compose environment, restart, register, then set it back to false.
      3. Once logged in, you can start building automation flows with 400+ pieces.

  - title: "Data persistence"
    description: |
      All data is stored in /var/lib/sulla/activepieces on the host, mapped to
      /root/.activepieces inside the container. This includes:
        - PGLite database files
        - Flow definitions and execution logs
        - Uploaded files and credentials

  - title: "Health check"
    description: |
      The container includes a built-in health check that curls http://localhost:80/
      every 30 seconds. Check container health with:
        docker compose -f ${COMPOSE_FILE} ps

  - title: "Useful commands"
    description: |
      Start:   docker compose -f ${COMPOSE_FILE} up -d
      Stop:    docker compose -f ${COMPOSE_FILE} down
      Restart: docker compose -f ${COMPOSE_FILE} restart
      Logs:    docker compose -f ${COMPOSE_FILE} logs --tail=100
      Update:  docker compose -f ${COMPOSE_FILE} pull && docker compose -f ${COMPOSE_FILE} up -d
